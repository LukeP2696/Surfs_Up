Create a single page application that retrieves tidal and weather based forecast information. There will be two aspects, the first
being server-side to retrieve the information, package it, and to store it on the server. The second being the client side to display
the stored information, after loading it into local storage.
An interface will need to be developed for the server-side to configure the location and other relevant attributes to be displayed
on the client side.
The clint side will have to store, read and display the information from local storage. It will also have to purge the data after a
given period of time and retrieve the updated information from the server. Handling will also have to be in place for not being
able to retrieve the server side information.
must be visually stunning and view able from a distance, will also be used on screens with a high pixel pitch (p16)
